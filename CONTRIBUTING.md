# Contributing to Partial

Any form of contribution to Partial is welcomed, including the opening of issues and pull requests.

## Opening an issue

Open a new issue to ask questions, submit bug reports, and request new feature.

When creating an issue you may use one of the provided templates, or create a new issue from scratch if one of the templates does not suit your issue.

## Opening a pull request

Creating a pull request to update the documentation, fix bugs, and add new features.

All pull requests will be manually reviewed, along with tests performed by CI. If your pull request modifies code (either by addition or modification) you must add tests that cover the changes. Exceptions will be made for pieces of code that cannot be reasonably tested (such as precondition failures that should never happen).

If you are unsure about the utility of your pull request, feel you would like help making the neccessary changes, or are otherwise unsure, please first open an issue to discuss the change.
